				<h1>Lilly F Wang</h1>
				<span>I am a sophomore studying Computer Scienceat the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.Along with my interest in programming, I am also pursuing a minor in psychology and specialization in pre-medical studies.<br><br>
				I grew up in a small northern suburb of Chicago called Lake Bluff. There, I attended Lake Forest High School and was part of the Varsity Swim Team, Math Team, EuroChallenge Team, Science Olympiad, and Red Cross Club. <br><br>
				At Columbia, I am part of the Undergraduate Recruitment Committee (URC), Engineers Without Borders (EWB), and FeelGood communities. Part of my role in the URC is to serve as the Engineering Coordinator where I get to lead and train new tour guides to give the General and Engineering tours of campus. I am on the public relations team for EWB, and our main goal the past year was to improve our chapter&#39;s online presence. The team created a new website, Twitter, Google+, and Facebook page to draw more attention to what our group does. FeelGood is just a fun group on campus I am a part of, and we specialize in making and delivering grilled cheese to hungry students around campus. <br><br>
				In terms of coding, I push myself to learn and try new things. For example, as of November 2013, I knew nothing about website design. Ask me what jQuery was, and I would have thought it was a programming language. I really wanted to learn how to do website design though, and I taught myself the basics of HTML/CSS, and Javascript. From November of last year to January of this year, I was able to create my whole website from scratch. This kind of drive carries over into all aspects of my life, and I am always eager to pick up new hobbies and skills that I can apply to create new things. <br><br>
				A last little fun fact about me is that F is my full middle name. It looks like there should be a period following my middle name on the front page; but since F is technically my full name, there is no need for it. I actually put one there out of habit, but my friend pointed out that it was technically wrong to have the period there in my case. The nakedness of the F probably looks as strange to you as it does to me.
