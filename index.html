				I grew up in suburb north of Chicago, and that's where I lived all of my life until I came to New York City for college. Now my family lives in Belmont, CA.
				<br>
				<br>
				I swam for Lake Forest High School, where we competed and placed at the State Championships. Our 200 Free Relay team also broke a pool record during my senior year in high school. I also preformed research over the summer of 2011 at University of Chicago on lysine crotonylation and wrote a research paper that I submitted to the Siemens Foundation. In October 2011, I was selected as a Siemens Regional Finalist and went to University of Notre Dame to compete and present my research. Here is an article about how Siemens it affected <a href="http://lakeforest.patch.com/groups/schools/p/scout-swimmer-makes-difficult-choice"; style="text-decoration:none">my swimming life</a>.

				I want to further develop my skills as a computer programmer and gain experience through working on different projects. The first major project I worked on was an unofficial version of Super Smash Brothers for fun. Although I have completed other small projects on my own and gained a huge sense of accomplishment from them, I'm ready to take it to the next level and apply what I learned in class to the real world.
